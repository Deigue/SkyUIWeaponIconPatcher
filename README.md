# SkyUIWeaponIconPatcher
Based off miniz [SynWeapKeywords](https://github.com/minis-patchers/SynWeaponKeywords), adjusted to patch for SkyUI Weapons Pack icon keywords

---
##### Note
Currently tested/working with only SkyUIWeaponIcons.esp, but should work fine as long as the base 
mods containing the keywords are added to the database.json sources. Current version of this patcher will
 **NOT** work properly or match Animated Armory keywords to get the proper animations.
